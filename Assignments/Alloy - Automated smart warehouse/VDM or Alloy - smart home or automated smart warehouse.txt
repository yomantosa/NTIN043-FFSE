topic: models in VDM or Alloy

task 1: create model for "smart home" or "automated smart warehouse"
  !! pick just one option !!

  option A: smart home
      - important aspects: various sensors, control, security and other equipment
      - you have to decide what entities and operations to capture in the model
          - example: temperature (heating), smoke, lights, cameras, movement, automated locking
          - example: automatically turn on/off some devices based on values recorded by sensors
      - do not forget to define some assertions (facts) and commands (run, check)

  option B: automated smart warehouse
      - context: modern partially automated warehouses equipped with many robots
      - what to capture in your model: packages (items), robots (transporting packages around the warehouse), human employees (their specific roles and interaction with robots), warehouse environment (tracks and virtual "roads" for the robots, various necessary equipment, other important "hardware", etc)
      - define some important properties of the dynamic/runtime state of the warehouse (some invariants, guarantees)

task 2: document your solution
	- explain key design decisions and more advanced usage of VDM/Alloy

task 3: evaluate your solution (model) according to the following criteria
	- level of abstraction (in the sense "what details you ignored")
	- level of approximation (over-, under-) in the sense "over-specification/over-constraining (specification is too restrictive) versus under-specification/under-constraining (model is too permissive)"
	- ambiguity versus precision
	- completeness (all scenarios)

task 4: tell me your opinion about the modeling language, tool, and the whole approach (methodology) based on your personal experience
	- specifically, can you imagine to use something like that (whole approach) in practice given proper tool support in some IDE
	- possible usage scenarios to consider: validating the design of a complex system, capturing and validating requirements (maybe for consistency), precise documentation

note: you can define the model in VDM or Alloy (pick one language)
