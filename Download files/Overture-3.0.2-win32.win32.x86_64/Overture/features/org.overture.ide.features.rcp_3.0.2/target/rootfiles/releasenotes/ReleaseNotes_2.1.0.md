# Overture 2.1.0 Release Notes — 12 June 2014 

## What's New?

This release is formally releases two major features: the new AST-based Proof Obligation Generator, and the Java code generator.

The new proof obligation generator uses a new internal representation for proof obligations.  The previous POG utilised strings, while the new POG uses ASTs.  This allows for further processing of the POs by other plugins.  From a user's perspective there should be little change --- only a few additional parentheses in the PO expressions.  The new POG is the first step towards supporting automatic discharging of proof obligations, which we hope to add in the near future.  Because of this, the new POG no longer the discharges trivial POs.

The VDM++ to Java code generator is now available as a non-experimental version.  It indicates to the user if a construct cannot be generated by highlighting it in the editor using a marker (similar to the way warnings are shown) and outputs messages about it in the console. Generated code is output in the `generated/java` folder with the VDM++ project in Overture.

The generated Java code depends on a runtime/library to represent VDM collections, VDM types, and so forth.  The source code for the runtime can be found in the Overture Github repository at: <https://github.com/overturetool/overture/tree/development/core/codegen-runtime>.
 

## System Requirements

Overture is based on the Eclipse platform.  To run it, you must have a Java runtime system installed, version 6 or later.


## Download & Installation

Documentation, including tutorials and a language manual, are bundled in the download package, and are also available from the [Overture website](http://www.overturetool.org/).

Overture can be downloaded from GitHub at <https://github.com/overturetool/overture/releases> or from the SourceForge site at <https://sourceforge.net/projects/overture/files/Overture_IDE/>.

The download file is a ZIP archive.  To install the tool, unzip the file in a convenient location.  The main executable is in the top level directory, called `Overture`.

We will be making an exe-based installer available for Windows user at a future point.


### Upgrading:

* ATTENTION: If you are using the ZIP archive to update and if your workspace was located inside the previous installation directory, DO NOT FORGET TO BACKUP the workspace or it will be lost when the old version is deleted.
* If you are upgrading with the ZIP archive: do not unzip the latest version on top of the oldest one.  You will need to delete the previous version before continuing the installation.


### Uninstalling

To uninstall Overture, remove the contents of the directory where you installed it.  There are no other files stored on the system, apart from any workspace files you may have created.

For Windows users, if the Overture installer was used previously, it is possible to uninstall via the uninstall shortcut created by the installer in the start programs or via the Uninstall menu in the Control Panel.


## Reporting Problems and Troubleshooting
