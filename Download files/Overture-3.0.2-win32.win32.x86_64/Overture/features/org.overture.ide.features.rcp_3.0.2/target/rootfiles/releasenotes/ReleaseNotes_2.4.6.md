# [Overture 2.4.6 - Release Notes - 06 March 2017](https://github.com/overturetool/overture/milestone/32)



## What's New?

This release contains a number of bug fixes covering the parser, type checker, quick interpreter and combinatorial testing. See the `Bugfixes` section for additional details.

In addition, a change has been made to Overture (see issue 613) that may give a noticeable interpreter performance improvement in specifications that internally throw several exceptions. This occurs naturally in specs with complex union types or which perform a lot of complex pattern matching. In specifications with traces a 20% performance improvement has been seen.

## Reporting Problems and Troubleshooting

Please report bugs, problems, and other issues with the tool at <https://github.com/overturetool/overture/issues>.

If you encounter a problem with the Overture IDE itself, please contact the Overture project and we will try to help.  You can contact us at info@overturetool.org, or use [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vdm%2b%2b) â€” we monitor for questions using the `vdm`, `vdm++`, or `vdmrt` tags.

If you encounter a problem with a VDM specification, please try to make a small example that illustrates the problem before you contact us.  If you are sure the bug is not already known in the GitHub issues list, you can create a new bug report.
