# [Overture 2.4.0 - Release Notes - 30 August 2016](https://github.com/overturetool/overture/milestones/v2.4.0)



## What's New?

Overture has been updated to include two new language features. The first language feature, which is based on Request for Modification (RM) 35, adds a set1 type constructor to the language. Second, VDM-10 now supports sequence bindings (RM 36), which allows iterating over sequences in a more concise way. For example, one can now write [ f(x) | x in seq s & P(x) ] rather than [ f(s(i)) | i in set inds s & P(s(i)) ].

In the previous release, Overture was upgraded to support self-update using Eclipse p2. It should therefore be possible to update Overture 2.3.8 to version 2.4.0 (this version) using p2. Make sure that the Eclipse release site is available: http://download.eclipse.org/releases/neon

Updating Overture to a newer version is similar to updating any other Eclipse application. From the menu choose

Help -> Install New Software...

Next, from the list of repositories select 'Overture Development', make sure you have 'Overture' selected, and execute the update.

Finally, Overture has been updated to build against the newest version of Eclipse (Neon).

## Reporting Problems and Troubleshooting
