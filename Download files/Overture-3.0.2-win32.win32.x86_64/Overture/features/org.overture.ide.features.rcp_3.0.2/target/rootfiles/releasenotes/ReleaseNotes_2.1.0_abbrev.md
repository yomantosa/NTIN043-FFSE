# Overture 2.1.0 Release Notes — 12 June 2014 

## What's New?

This release is formally releases two major features: the new AST-based Proof Obligation Generator, and the Java code generator.

The new proof obligation generator uses a new internal representation for proof obligations.  The previous POG utilised strings, while the new POG uses ASTs.  This allows for further processing of the POs by other plugins.  From a user's perspective there should be little change --- only a few additional parentheses in the PO expressions.  The new POG is the first step towards supporting automatic discharging of proof obligations, which we hope to add in the near future.  Because of this, the new POG no longer the discharges trivial POs.

The VDM++ to Java code generator is now available as a non-experimental version.  It indicates to the user if a construct cannot be generated by highlighting it in the editor using a marker (similar to the way warnings are shown) and outputs messages about it in the console. Generated code is output in the `generated/java` folder with the VDM++ project in Overture.

The generated Java code depends on a runtime/library to represent VDM collections, VDM types, and so forth.  The source code for the runtime can be found in the Overture Github repository at: <https://github.com/overturetool/overture/tree/development/core/codegen-runtime>.
 

## Reporting Problems and Troubleshooting

Please report bugs, problems, and other issues with the tool at <https://github.com/overturetool/overture/issues>.

If you encounter a problem with the Overture IDE itself, please contact the Overture project and we will try to help.  You can contact us at info@overturetool.org, or use [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vdm%2b%2b) — we monitor for questions using the `vdm`, `vdm++`, or `vdmrt` tags.

If you encounter a problem with a VDM specification, please try to make a small example that illustrates the problem before you contact us.  If you are sure the bug is not already known in the GitHub issues list, you can create a new bug report.
