Overture 2.0.0 Release Notes — 27/11/2013
==========================================


What's New in Overture 2.0.0?
-----------------------------

This release is a re-engineering of the internal structure of Overture
to use a single AST across all components in the system.


System Requirements
-------------------

Overture is based on the Eclipse platform.  To run it, you must have a
Java runtime system installed, version 6 or later.


Downloading
-----------

Overture can be downloaded from the SourceForge site, at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/overture/files/Overture_IDE/2.0.0/.

Documentation, including download instructions, tutorials and a
language manual, are bundled in the download package, and are also
available from the [Overture website](http://www.overturetool.org/).


Installing
----------

The download file is a ZIP archive.  To install the tool, unzip the
file in a convenient location.  The main executable is in the top
level directory, called `Overture`.

We will be making an exe-based installer available for Windows user at
a future point.

### Upgrading:

* ATTENTION: If you are using the ZIP archive to update and if your
  workspace was located inside the previous installation directory, DO
  NOT FORGET TO BACKUP the workspace or it will be lost when the old
  version is deleted.
* If you are upgrading with the ZIP archive: do not unzip the latest
  version on top of the oldest one.  You will need to delete the
  previous version before continuing the installation.


Uninstalling
------------

To uninstall Overture, remove the contents of the directory where you
installed it.  There are no other files stored on the system, apart
from any workspace files you may have created.

For Windows users, if the Overture installer was used previously, it
is possible to uninstall via the uninstall shortcut created by the
installer in the start programs or via the Uninstall menu in the
Control Panel.
