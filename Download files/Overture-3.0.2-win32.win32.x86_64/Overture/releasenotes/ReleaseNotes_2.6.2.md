# [Overture 2.6.2 - Release Notes - 18 May 2018](https://github.com/overturetool/overture/milestone/39)

## What's New?

This release contains fixes for the type-checker, interpreter and Java/JML code-generator. In addition, the Overture command-line interface (CLI) now supports the "-version" argument (which is helpful if the CLI is invoked from a build-job). A more elaborate list of issues addressed since the last release can be found below.

## Reporting Problems and Troubleshooting

Please report bugs, problems, and other issues with the tool at <https://github.com/overturetool/overture/issues>.

If you encounter a problem with the Overture IDE itself, please contact the Overture project and we will try to help.  You can contact us at info@overturetool.org, or use [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vdm%2b%2b) â€” we monitor for questions using the `vdm`, `vdm++`, or `vdmrt` tags.

If you encounter a problem with a VDM specification, please try to make a small example that illustrates the problem before you contact us.  If you are sure the bug is not already known in the GitHub issues list, you can create a new bug report.
