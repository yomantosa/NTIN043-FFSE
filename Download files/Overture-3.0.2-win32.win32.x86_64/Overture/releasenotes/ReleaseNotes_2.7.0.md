## Reporting Problems and Troubleshooting

Please report bugs, problems, and other issues with the tool at <https://github.com/overturetool/overture/issues>.

If you encounter a problem with the Overture IDE itself, please contact the Overture project and we will try to help.  You can contact us at info@overturetool.org, or use [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vdm%2b%2b) â€” we monitor for questions using the `vdm`, `vdm++`, or `vdmrt` tags.

If you encounter a problem with a VDM specification, please try to make a small example that illustrates the problem before you contact us.  If you are sure the bug is not already known in the GitHub issues list, you can create a new bug report.
