# [Overture 2.6.4 - Release Notes - 19 October 2018](https://github.com/overturetool/overture/milestone/40)


## What's New?

This release contains some type-checker fixes and improvements for the user interface.

Note that Overture requires Java 8. If you're using more recent versions of Java (e.g. version 10) you may experience errors when you launch Overture. In particular, Overture, currently builds against Eclipse Oxygen, which is known to have issues related to recent versions of Java. In case you experience issues try to follow the suggestions in the [FAQ](http://overturetool.org/faq/) (see "Q: Why can’t I open Overture using the latest versions of Java?").
