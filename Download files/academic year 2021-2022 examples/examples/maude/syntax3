sorts Zero NzNat Nat .
subsorts Zero NzNat < Nat .
op 0 : -> Zero [ctor] .
op _/_ : Nat NzNat -> Nat .

--- chain of division operations
3 / (3 / 1)

--- solution 1 (conditional membership axiom)
var N : Nat .
var M : NzNat .
cmb N / M : NzNat if (N =/= 0) .

--- solution 2 (membership axiom)
vars N M : NzNat .
mb N / M : NzNat .

--- another example (graph edges and paths)
cmb E ; P : Path if target(E) = source(P)
